      <p>
        When I'm not immersed in code or brainstorming for my next idea, you can
        always find me indulging in a couple of my favorite activities that
        bring me joy and help me relax. I often find myself nestled in a cozy
        corner, with a book in my lap and a steaming cup of coffee by my side.
        Alternatively, I enjoy the soothing company of my feline friends.
